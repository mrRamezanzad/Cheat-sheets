# =================== in client side we add socket library as a cdn
let socket = io({queyr: `username=${username}`})
# by sending query when creating first connection on every emit we will have access to that data in this case username

# sends request from client to server
socket.emit('new user', {username: username})

# when ever we emmit [fires event] we should have a counter io.on [listens for event] for it in other side

# we have access to informations of socket by handshake
socket.handshake.query.username

# sends message to everyone exept the sender
socket.broadcast('new message', {message: "hello", user: "ali"})
